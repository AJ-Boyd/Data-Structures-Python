Hello there!

My name is AJ Boyd, and I'm a computer science major at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. Data structures is a core part of becoming a strong programmer, so I've made this repository as a way to showcase my knowledge on the subject and to demonstrate my profeciency with the Python programming language.

This repository features some very common data structures such as linked lists, trees, and heaps and some of the various implementations of each structure. The goal is to create efficient, readable, and functional code that is easy for even non-technical people to understand.

Enjoy and be amazed!
