desc: this is an implementation of a doubly linked list with both a head and tail Node.
    the key difference between a singly and doubly linked list is that a doubly linked list
    has both a next and prev attribute, allowing each node to see its preceeding Node.
    this program has two classes Node and LinkedList. linked lists are a fundamental 
    data structure that features dynamic size, O(1) time complexity for insertion/deletion 
    at the beginning and end, and a simple implementation method.
